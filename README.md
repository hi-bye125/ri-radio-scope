# Raffles Institution Radio Telescope
This is a joint venture between the Y56 Astronomy Club and Y14 Science and Astronomy Club, to make Singapore's first Open-Source Amateur Radio Telescope (as far as we are aware)

## About our telescope
Our telescope consists of a TBD-meter parabolic antenna that allows anyone to make continuous and spectral (i.e. [hydrogen line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_line)) observations of the radio sky in the **TBD MHz** regime for free. 

The goal of this effort is to introduce students, educators, astronomers and others to the majesty of the radio sky, **promoting radio astronomy education**, and providing a template for interested schools and individuals to build their own telescopes

This is a **fully open source** (software & hardware) project.
